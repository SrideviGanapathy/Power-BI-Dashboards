# AdventureWorks Sales Dashboard #

This Power BI Dashboard was created from one of Microsoft's sample databases: AdventureWorks 2022. AdventureWorks is a fictious bicycle and accessories manufacturing company selling its product across six countries in total in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. The database was hosted in SQL Server 2022 and was brought into Power BI using SQL queries.

The goal of this dashboard is to shed light on the revenue and profit figures of the company, thereby delivering insights into what drives the company's earnings. The dashboard has two pages: Revenue analysis and Profit analysis.

## Revenue Analysis ##

* The revenue was first analysed by country, revealing that USA ($70M) brings in the largest revenue followed by Canada ($18M), Australia ($11M) and the European countries. Then, on analyzing the annual revenue figures, 2013 ($49M) had the highest revenue followed by 2012 ($38M).

* Analysing based on product subcategories, surprisingly, Jerseys ($57M) captured the highest revenue exceeding revenue from the primary product of the company: Bikes. The other top subcategories were: Roadbikes ($55M), Helmets ($53M), Caps ($50M) and Mountain bikes ($49M).

* A monthly analysis of the revenue revealed two anomalies: An exceptionally high revenue of $8M in March 2014 and an exceptionally low revenue of $54K in June 2014. While high revenue is always welcome and could be due to promotional sales, sharp decline in revenue always needs careful attention to prevent the company from enduring irrecoverable losses. The anomalies were detected using the Power BI's analysis features for visuals.

## Profit Analysis ##

* Moving to the profit analysis, annual profit values indicate that 2013 was the most profitable year followed by 2014. Another detail to be noted was that profit from accessories and clothing have greatly increased after 2012.

* Profit by country unravelled that Australia which had the third largest revenue, was the most profitable market. USA which had a staggeringly high revenue came second in profit. Another notable fact was that Canada with second highest revenue proved to be the least profitable market. This reveals that Australia is a very lucrative market for further growth potential and that USA and Canada require price optimization.

* Product category wise profit establishes that Bikes are the most profitable products earning 85% of the total profit followed by accessories and components with 6% and 5% respectively.

* Based on product subcategories, using the Key Influencers visual,road frames and jerseys were the least profitable and mountain bikes were found to be the most profitable. This shows that though jerseys have the highest revenue, they are being sold at the lowest margins and even with losses.

## Conclusion ##

This analysis of the company's financials though a wide variety of visauls in Power BI reveals eye-opening details which when used to make data-driven decisions can further boost the growth of the company.
